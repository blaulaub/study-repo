# Study Sorting in Java

This is a scratch project to implement and evaluate some standard sorting algorithms.
There is no big invention here, it is just a programming exercise,
the sole goal is to become a bit more familiar with some basic algorithms.

## Some Algorithms

- bubble sort (the ugly) 

## Key Criteria

- performance, operations
- extra memory (probably not very important)
